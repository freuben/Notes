I would like to express profound gratitude to all of the people who helped and supported me during the time in which this creative work was undertaken. I would especially like to thank my parents, William and Victoria for all of their love, support and guidance. They have always encouraged me to pursue my fascination and love for music and to follow my aspirations as a musician. The earliest memories I have about music are indebted to them: since childhood they encouraged me to go to concerts and supported my piano lessons. Their intelligence, courage, kindness and commitment to social causes, continue to be a source of admiration and inspiration for me. I would also like to thank the rest of my family for their unconditional love and support. I want to thank my brother for his support as well as for giving me an example of what can be achieved through high ideals, dedication and intellectual rigor. I also would like to thank my grandparents, cousins, uncles and aunts, for their emotional and intellectual encouragement, even if it is from a long distance.
