%A little introduction to my work before PhD. Concerns at the begining of the PhD an how they evolved in time. Explanation of the way I'm writing the commentary and why. etc. etc.

In the first two chapters, I will attempt to tackle different concerns regarding a single question that I consider to be central to my approach in recent years to the way I compose, perform, listen and think about music. The question being: what is radical music today? The idea of \emph{radical music} has fundamentally changed in recent years and today it is hard to think of any music as being radical. This is partly due to the fact that for some years now the prevailing ideology in thinking and writing about music has been one of skepticism and indifference towards radical ideas and innovation in how we make, present and perceive music. By radical ideas and innovation, I do not mean music that is technologically ground breaking or innovative only in specific considerations to a particular set of musical parameters or new ideas that are relevant only to the specialist's theoretical interest. What I mean is music that is perceived as radical within our contemporary culture and redefines what \emph{music is} in the community, what it means to us, how it is perceived and defined.

Another obstacle in redefining \emph{radical music} has been the recent trend to look for new terminology which applies to practices relating to sound that defy conventional definitions and functions of music. New terms such as Sonic Arts, Sound Art and Audio Arts have emerged in an attempt to justify these new practices. It has been precisely the cultural resistance and unwillingness toward accepting \emph{radical music} that has motivated the invention of new definitions that try to identify these sonic practices as `other' arts and not as music. The reluctance to widening the definition of \emph{what music is} has motivated some to search for new definitions that they believe will give some acceptance and legitimacy to their practices. Instead of embracing this approach, I propose one should struggle more with the concept of \emph{music}, and in my opinion, one should strive to redefine \emph{what music is} rather than following the fashionable rebranding of sound related practices. 

%This is important, I think because. . . .

%-Division of Music and Music Tech/Sonic Arts, etc.

%-Technological Innovation is not equal to Radical or Innovation in Music!

It is in my attempt to rethink what \emph{radical music} is today, that I believe Jaques Ranci\`{e}re's work proves to be helpful, particularly in establishing a relationship between \emph{music} and \emph{radical thought}, and more specifically \emph{radical thought} as it relates to politics. Therefore, in \hyperlink{chapter2}{Chapter 2}, I will give theoretical background based on Ranci\`{e}re's views on the relationship between aesthetics and politics. Additionally, I undertake the task of trying to apply his concepts as they pertain to music.
