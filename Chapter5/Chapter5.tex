\section{Appropriation Art}

\begin{quote}
The contemporary era constantly proclaims itself as post-ideological, but this denial of ideology only provides the ultimate proof that we are more than ever embedded in ideology. Ideology is always a field of struggle---among other things, the struggle for appropriating past traditions.\footnote{\hyperlink{zizektragedy}{\v{Z}i\v{z}ek (2009)}, `It's Ideology, Stupid!', p. 37.}

\subsection {Postproduction}

\begin{quote}
Starting with the language imposed upon us (the \emph{system} of production), we construct our own sentences (\emph{acts} of everyday life), thereby reappropriating for ourselves, through these clandestine microbricolages, the last word in the productive chain. Production thus becomes a lexicon of a practice, which is to say, the intermediary material from which new utterances can be articulated, instead of representing the end result of anything. What matters is what we make of the elements placed at our disposal. . . . By listening to music or reading a book, we produce new material, we become producers. And each day we benefit from more ways in which to organize this production: remote controls, VCRs, computers, MP3s, tools that allow us to select, reconstruct, and edit. Postproduction artists are agents of this evolution, the specialized workers of cultural reappropriation.\footnote{\hyperlink{postproduction}{Bourriaud (2005)}, pp. 24-25.}

\begin{quote}
Throughout the eighties, the democratization of computers and the appearance of sampling allowed for the emergence of a new cultural configuration, whose figures are the programmer and DJ. The remixer has become more important than the instrumentalist, the rave more exciting than the concert hall. The supremacy of cultures of appropriation and the reprocessing of forms calls for an ethics: to paraphrase Philippe Thomas, artworks belong to everyone. Contemporary art tends to abolish the ownership of forms, or in any case to shake up the old jurisprudence. Are we heading toward a culture that would do away with copyright in favor of a policy allowing free access to works, a sort of blueprint for a communism of forms?\footnote{Ibid. p. 35.}
